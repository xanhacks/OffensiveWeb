## Information leakage

- [Linkedin - Information disclosure by sending a GIF](https://hackerone.com/reports/1801427) - The victim automatically requests a webhook (fake GIF URL) when opening a message. This allows an attacker to retrieve the victim's UA and IP address.

## Domains Takeover

- [Brave - S3 Bucket Takeover](https://hackerone.com/reports/1835133) - An attacker can claim an S3 bucket that was previously used by Brave but now deleted.

## SSRF

- [Imgur - SSRF Attack Surface](https://hackerone.com/reports/115748) - SSRF vulnerability which allows an attacker to craft connections originating from imgur servers.
